There are intrinsic ethical and privacy considerations with using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image identification, especially one as complex as the one developed for CIFAR-10. These issues should be carefully taken into account. Even though the model might be quite good at differentiating between cars and animals, using it to photos with faces raises serious privacy and ethical concerns. Such algorithms' capability to identify and classify specific people raises questions of data ownership, user consent, and the possibility of unlawful surveillance. The contentious activities of ClearView AI, as covered by Hill (2020), highlight the difficulties that arise when facial recognition technology is used in the absence of strong legal protections, possibly violating individuals' right to privacy. 
Furthermore, the possibility of discriminating consequences is highlighted by the proven biases in facial recognition systems, especially in accuracy differences across different demographic groups (Najibi, 2020). Strict ethical norms, regulatory monitoring, and openness are necessary when implementing this algorithm in situations involving human photographs in order to allay these worries and protect people's privacy.
